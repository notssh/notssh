### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm NOTSSH, russian teenager-geek.
- Python 3 enjoyer
- Intersted in web-dev
- Alpine Linux admin

Iâ€™m currently learning Python 3. I also plan to start learning JS and Kotlin. Interested in web-development, now I'm studying aiogram, aiohttp, FastAPI, sqlalchemy and the like.
I also have my own small home server on Alpine Linux. Linux administration is quite an interesting and useful activity, imho.
